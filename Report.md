Natural Language Q&A Search System

# Abstract

The problem to be solved is answering a given natural question (i.e. a question given in natural language) by first interpreting the meaning of the question, then searching for the answer from the existing dataset. We will be using Haystack, which is an open-source framework for answering natural questions.
